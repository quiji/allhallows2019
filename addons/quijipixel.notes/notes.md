Vamp kill:


A game about boss fights.

Vampires are ridiculously overpowered.
The boss arena can be a full house (as he can push the hero over walls and into other rooms), offering
A lot of variation in the fight.

The player can find different ways to battle the vampires, gathering hidden lore that gives insight to develop battle plans to kill them.

The hero is human, therefore very very weak, but he can “cancel” or prevent different vampire attacks by getting the right items, or devising the right strategy. So learning about the vampires and how to kill them can create sooo many different ways to kill them.

heart mechanic: A heart is there pumping nicely. When timed with the heart beat, the hero wakes up from the blood sucking.

The Contract: Doomed to live the same day forever until the contract is fullfilled.

NEW IDEA: After certain conditions Solomon dies and becomes a vampire. The enemy mechanics no apply to him
and everything is seen through a different light.

Vampire lore:
	- Young vampires: 
		- Basic abilities:
			- Quick
			- Undead
			- Levitate
			- Sunlight burns them
	- Older vampires:
		- Drinking another beings blood grants their "abilities"
		- Killing and drinking an older vampires blood grants the abilities he has gathered with time
		- When older and stronger (by consuming a lot of blood), they recover their human appaerance.
		- They gain inmmunity to sunlight
		- Abilities:
			- Strength: Drink werewolf blood. Can punch Solomon from room to room. Deals a lot of physical damage.
			- Telekinesis: Drink ???'s blood?? or learned?. Can levitate stuff. Throw stuff at Sol.
			- Morphosis: Drink ????'s blood?? or developed? Transform into mist. Generate attacks of "mist".
			- Invisibility/Darkness: Drink ???'s blood? or developed? Become invisible. This might be related to mist instead (one less by redundance)
			- Demon Blood?
			- Angel Blood?
			-Necromancy: Whos blood? Inherent ability? Revive dead soldiers. Maybe for some vampires, their house is filled with living guards. 
				After killing them, and fight the vampire, he can revive them as many times as he likes.
	- Sol's Armament:
		- Pistol: a Custom made gun made to handle different size of bullets.
			-Magazines: Sol can carry up to 4 different gun magazines. Each magazine can carry one type of bullet. 
				It depends on the bullets size, how many of them can be held in the magazine. These bullets can be crafted by the player with different elements, and have different effects
				on the nosferatus.
			- Granades: Sol can carry up to 4 hand granades. They can be custom made like the bullets and perform different efects on its targets.
			- Wooden knife: Made with some artifact wood. The knife is to pierce the vampires heart when is weak enough. only way to kill them.
